# Vacuum Live Map (Valetudo or Valetudo RE only)
![Homekit Infused](../images/vacuum-live-map.png)

### Description
This is a simple live map for a (xiaomi) vacuum cleaner, a rooted vacuum with Valetudo (RE) is required!

### Configuration
- You will have to have to root your vacuum with either Valetudo or Valetudo RE and also run the separate mapper container to show store the map values.
- I will not explain how to root your vacuum as there are plenty tutorials out there on the internet. You can however check quickly if your vacuum is supported by visiting [Dustbuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/), click on the vacuum image to see if it is supported!
- There is a short explanation on how to root your vacuum available on our discord server (check out the #jimz011-and-dwains-tips channel).
- I personally use [Valetudo RE](https://github.com/rand256/valetudo) as I think it is better than [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo). But this is entirely up to you. If you use Valetudo RE you can activate MQTT through the settings in the webui of the vacuum cleaner, which will save you a lot of trouble.
- This addon will work for ANY vacuum that can send out a camera entity. If your vacuum happens to not be rooted with Valetudo (RE) but does have a camera entity, then this will likely work for you as well!
