# Weather Card
![Homekit Infused](../images/weather-card.png)

### Description
This is a normal (animated) weather card.

### Requirements (HACS)

| Name | Type  | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Weather Card](https://github.com/bramkragten/weather-card) | Frontend | This is a customizable animated weather card, see screenshot for details |

### Resources
Add the following line to your lovelace resources 
```
/hacsfiles/weather-card/weather-card.js
```

### Configuration
To use this you must have dark sky setup, If you do NOT have a dark sky API key then you are out of luck since dark sky no longer hands out API keys. Existing users of darksky can use their API keys until 2021 until they cease to work. The card might work with other weather entities, however this has NOT been tested!

Below an example of your configuration.yaml:
```
# Example configuration.yaml entry
weather:
  - platform: darksky
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    mode: daily
```
If you want to show the sunrise and sunset times, make sure the sun component. This integration is by default enabled, unless youâ€™ve disabled or removed the default_config: line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:
```
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sun:
```

### Layout card and horizontal/vertical stacks
I know the HA documentation has this perfectly explained already, but to make it easier on you I will try to explain in more detail [here](../addons/stacks.md)
